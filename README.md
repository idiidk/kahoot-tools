# Kahoot Tools Vue
> Scaring teachers since Sep 27, 2017!

This release is intended for educational purposes only. This project is pretty outdated and I won't be supporting it any longer. It's still a good source for anyone looking to unravel the inner workings of Kahoot.

## Quick Start
To quickly start using kahoot-tools after installation, please refer to the quick start guide (WIP)

## Installation

OS X, Linux and Windows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/idiidk/kahoot-tools.git
cd kahoot-tools
npm install # or use yarn
# Edit config.json
npm run build
npm run host
```

To run kahoot-tools-vue in dev mode, follow the steps above but replace ```npm run build``` with: ```npm run serve```. 

In dev mode, you need to run the cors proxy in a seperate terminal. Use the command: ```npm run proxy```
